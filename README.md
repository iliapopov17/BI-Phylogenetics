# Repository for Phylogenetics Course Guides in Bioinformatics Institute

This repository for **Phylogenetics Course *Guides*** in *Bioinformatics Institute 2023-2024*

It can be used as a helpful repository with all possible cheat-sheets for phylogenetic studies

## Rooting and comparing trees & Dating

In the [Root Date folder](5%20-%20Root%20Date) there is guide how to root trees using different approaches (by a known external clade / `midpoint rooting` / `non-reversible` model), how to compare these approaches and how to perform root-supporte tree visualisation (`rootstrap`). Also there is a mini-project on dating the common ancestor of smoky leopards with "full-circle" study: downloading the data from NCBI using `efetch`, aligning the sequences with `mafft`, trimming with `trimal` and tree construnction with `iqtree2` followed by visualization and analysis in GUI apps: `Beauti`, `Tracer`, `TreeAnnotator` and `FigTree`.

## Preparing the alignment and building trees

In the [Trees folder](4%20-%20Trees) there is guide how to prepare the alignment by cutting bad areas out of with `trimAl`, how to select the model with `ModelTest-NG` and `ModelFinder`, how to perform a tree search with `RaxML-NG` and `IQ-TREE` and how to do topology assesment with `bootstrap`.

## Multiple sequence alignment

In the [MSA folder](3%20-%20MSA) there is guide how to perform multiple sequence alignment using all possible tools (`clustalw`, `clustalo` `muscle`, `mafft`, `kalign`, `tcoffee`, `prank`).

## Working with NCBI

In the [Mining data folder](2%20-%20Mining%20Data) there is guide how to work with NCBI using all possible ways - `R` (`reutils`), `Python` (`Bio::Entrez`) and `bash` (`esearch`).

## Drawing Trees

In the [Intro Trees folder](1%20-%20Intro%20Trees) there is guide how to draw phylogenetic trees using both `R` (`ape`, `ggtree`) and `Python` (`Bio::Phylo`, `ete3`).
