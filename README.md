# Repository for Phylogenetics Course Homeworks in Bioinformatics Institute

This repository for **Phylogenetics Course *Homeworks*** in *Bioinformatics Institute 2023-2024*

It can be used as a helpful repository with all possible cheat-sheets for phylogenetic studies

## Lesson 4. Preparing the alignment and building trees

In [Lesson 4](4%20-%20Trees) we learnt how to prepare the alignment by cutting bad areas out of with `trimAl`, how to select the model with `ModelTest-NG` and `ModelFinder`, how to perform a tree search with `RaxML-NG` and `IQ-TREE` and how to do topology assesment with `bootstrap`.

## Lesson 3. Multiple sequence alignment

In [Lesson 3](3%20-%20MSA) we learnt how to perform multiple sequence alignment using all possible tools (`clustalw`, `clustalo` `muscle`, `mafft`, `kalign`, `tcoffee`, `prank`).

## Lesson 2. Working with NCBI

In [Lesson 2](2%20-%20Mining%20Data) we learnt how to work with NCBI using all possible ways - `R` (`reutils`), `Python` (`Bio::Entrez`) and `bash` (`esearch`).

## Lesson 1. Drawing Trees

In [Lesson 1](1%20-%20Intro%20Trees) we learnt how to draw phylogenetic trees using both `R` (`ape`, `ggtree`) and `Python` (`Bio::Phylo`, `ete3`).
